Welcome to Faith & Anime! Here you'll find reviews and discussions about anime through a faith-based perspective.

## About Me

I’m a 46-year-old from West Liberty, Kentucky, where I was born and raised. Growing up in a small town, I was immersed in a close-knit community where my father served as a preacher. Church was a central part of my life, and I regularly heard the gospel message. However, I didn’t fully embrace my faith until age 35. I wanted my commitment to Christianity to be my own, not just a reflection of my father’s role, so I took time to make that step independently.
At 16, I discovered anime through *Ghost in the Shell*, which completely reshaped my view of animation. Unlike the cartoons of my childhood, anime captivated me with its creativity and intellectual depth. I spent years watching anime with friends. Now, as a Christian, I view anime through a faith-based lens, recognizing elements in its rich Japanese cultural context that implicitly or explicitly point to Christ.
My goal is to create a website that reviews and discusses anime from a Christian perspective. I hope to provide a resource for Christians navigating the growing influence of anime, offering insights on how to engage with it thoughtfully.
